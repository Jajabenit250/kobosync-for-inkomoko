## üöÄ Project Overview

Welcome to the **KoboSync Data Extraction System**! This project is all about making it easier to extract, process, and store survey data from KoboToolbox. We built it with performance and scalability in mind, so whether you‚Äôre dealing with a handful of surveys or thousands, this system has you covered.

### What You'll Love About It:

- **Lightning-fast** data extraction thanks to ClickHouse
- Real-time updates via **webhooks**
- **Rock-solid** data quality checks to keep everything in check
- **Daily scheduled extractions** so you don‚Äôt have to worry about missing any data
- **Built to scale** as your data grows

---

## üí° Key Decisions and Rationale

Here‚Äôs a quick rundown of some key choices I made while building this system and why:

1. **Database Choice: ClickHouse**
   - **Why?** We picked ClickHouse because it‚Äôs awesome at handling large datasets and running analytical queries quickly. Perfect for the kind of heavy lifting that's needed.

2. **Data Model: Normalized Structure**
   - **Why?** A normalized structure keeps the data clean, makes queries faster, and reduces redundancy. It also makes future updates and maintenance much easier.

3. **Real-time Processing: Webhook Implementation**
   - **Why?** We added a webhook so that every time a new survey submission comes in, it gets processed immediately. No waiting around!

4. **Data Quality: Comprehensive Checks**
   - **Why?** Data quality is non-negotiable. We implemented checks at multiple stages to ensure the data is reliable and accurate.

5. **Asynchronous Processing: FastAPI and asyncio**
   - **Why?** FastAPI with asyncio lets us handle multiple tasks at once without slowing down. This makes the system more responsive.

6. **Scalability: Distributed Architecture**
   - **Why?** We designed it to scale horizontally, so as your data grows, the system can easily grow with it.

7. **Error Handling and Logging: Comprehensive Approach**
   - **Why?** Good logging and error handling make it easier to troubleshoot issues and keep everything running smoothly.

8. **Testing: Comprehensive Test Suite**
   - **Why?** We set up a full suite of tests to make sure everything works as expected and to catch any issues early.

9. **Security: Multiple Layers**
   - **Why?** Security is key, so I implemented several layers of protection to keep your data safe.

10. **Performance Optimization: ClickHouse-Specific Techniques**
    - **Why?** We wanted to get the most out of ClickHouse, so I used some of its unique features to optimize performance even further.

## üõ†Ô∏è System Architecture

Let‚Äôs take a quick look at how everything fits together:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[KoboToolbox API] --> B[KoboDataService]
    B --> C[KoboExtractionService]
    C --> D[ClickHouse Database]
    E[Webhook] --> F[WebhookController]
    F --> C
    G[Cron Job] --> B
    H[DataQualityService] --> D
    J[API Endpoints] --> H
    J --> C
    K[Error Handling & Logging] --> L[Log Files]
    M[Monitoring System] --> D
    M --> J
```

Everything starts with KoboToolbox. I extracted the data using `KoboService`, store it in ClickHouse, and then handle it through our API or process it in real-time via the webhook.

    start_time DateTime,
    end_time DateTime,
    survey_date Date,

ORDER BY (_id, unique_id, question_key);
```

### Configuration:

1. Update your `.env` file with all the necessary environment variables.
   use these configurations
   ```

  CLICKHOUSE_DATABASE=default
  CLICKHOUSE_HOST=52.54.67.242
  CLICKHOUSE_USER=kobouser
  CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=strongpassword
  CLICKHOUSE_PORT=8123
  PORT=3030
  ```

### Deployment:
1. Fire up the containers with `docker-compose up -d`.

### Testing:
1. Run tests with `pytest` to make sure everything‚Äôs working as expected.
2. Use the provided Postman collection to test out the API endpoints.

---

## üìö Usage Guide

### Extracting Data
To pull data from KoboToolbox manually, hit up the `/kobo/extract` endpoint. All the data will be stored in the ClickHouse tables.

### Viewing Data Quality Issues
Need to check for any data quality issues? The `/data-quality/check` endpoint has got you covered.

### Webhook for Real-time Updates
If you want to get data as soon as it‚Äôs submitted, make sure to register your webhook URL with KoboToolbox.

### Surveys List
Want to see a list of all the surveys in the system? Just call the `/surveys` endpoint.

## ‚úÖ Data Quality Checks

2. **Value Range Checks**: Ensures that numeric fields fall within acceptable ranges. For example, ages or response counts are checked to make sure they're realistic.
3. **Date Consistency**: Verifies that date fields, such as `submission_time`, `start_time`, and `end_time`, make sense chronologically.
4. **Geolocation Validation**: Confirms that geolocation data falls within valid latitude and longitude ranges.
5. **Unique Constraint Checks**: Ensures that fields like `unique_id` remain unique across the dataset.
6. **Cross-field Validation**: Looks at the relationships between fields to ensure they make sense together, like making sure `end_time` is after `start_time`.

---

## ‚ö° Real-time Processing

Our system is designed to handle real-time data processing efficiently. As soon as a new survey submission is made, it's captured by the webhook and processed immediately, updating the database and running data quality checks on the fly. This ensures that your data is always up-to-date and ready for analysis.

### Webhook Workflow:
1. **Kobo Submission**: A new submission is made in KoboToolbox.
2. **Webhook Triggered**: The webhook captures the submission and sends it to our system.
3. **Processing & Storage**: The data is validated, processed, and stored in ClickHouse.
4. **Data Quality Checks**: All quality checks are run to ensure the data is accurate and consistent.

---

## üß™ Testing

Testing is a core part of our development process. I did implemented a comprehensive suite of tests to ensure the system works as expected under different scenarios.

### Test Types:
- **Unit Tests**: Check individual components to ensure they perform as expected.

## üöÄ Performance Optimization

Performance is key, especially when dealing with large datasets. We‚Äôve implemented several optimizations to keep things running fast and smooth:

### Key Optimizations:
- **Indexing**: Strategic indexing in ClickHouse to speed up queries.
- **Batch Processing**: Data is processed in batches where possible, reducing the load on the system.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Utilizing FastAPI‚Äôs async capabilities to handle multiple requests concurrently without slowing down.
- **Caching**: Frequently accessed data is cached to reduce the need for repetitive database queries.
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficiently managing database connections to prevent bottlenecks.
